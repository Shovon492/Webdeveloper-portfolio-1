<p class="banner-description">Thanks for checking in. If you clicked this article, I guess you are curious about what it’s like to break into the development industry.
    Now that I have tried it, I can confirm that a career change is PRETTY scary. The tech industry is PRETTY brutal. The learning curve of software engineering is PRETTY steep. HOWEVER, it is also super rewarding, fun and empowering.</p>

            <p class="item-description">A few ideas:

                Write good software for a company that is changing the world in a good way.
                Work for a company that pays high salaries and donate part of your income good causes.
                Write good software in your free time that helps others.</p>

            <h3 class="section-title">Why Web Development?</h3>
            <p class="section-description">Web developers provide businesses with the unique, engaging websites they need to connect with customers. While businesses could feasibly create their own sites using Wix, Squarespace, or WordPress templates, these tend to look amateurish and run slowly compared to sites built by professional Web Developers.</p>
